<center><b>Blueshield Regulations & Procedures</b></center><BR><BR>


<small><center><b>Blueshields & the Chain of Command/Station Relations</b></center><BR><BR>


You are obligated to obey the orders and protect any Nanotrasen Official (<i>including the Internal Affairs Agent and any faxes/NT announcements</i>) followed by the Captain, any Head of Staff you are currently protecting, and other Heads.<BR>

These people that you are charged to protect will hereby be referred to as VIPs unless specifically named, and take priority for protection in this order.<BR>

Respond to any request for help from any VIP in the order of the chain of command. So, if the CMO and the Captain call for help at the same time, the Captain takes priority, barring extenuating circumstances - do not play secretary to the Captain while the CMO is screaming in pain over the common channel. However, if two Heads are requesting aid in one location and the Captain is requesting aid in another, it may be best to assist the Heads if the danger is the same for both.<BR>

The Head of Security is a special case, as he is the most capable of protecting himself, and more likely to demand you assist Security rather than him. Assist him personally if he is outmatched or injured. It is not recommended to escort him otherwise.<BR>

You may, and often should, call upon Security to assist you when a VIP is in danger. They should also be picking up anyone you needed to restrain. It is not your job to arrest or brig crew, and you should not assist Security with maintaining general station order unless it endangers a VIP.<BR>

ERT, while being from Central Command, do not count as VIPs and are there specifically to aid the crew. Treat them as you would Security.<BR>

Your fellow Blueshield will be an invaluable asset to your duties and likely your closest companion. Coordinate with them.<BR>


In general you should not interfere with the station at all unless it relates to a VIP. Injuries, crime, and the like are all out of your jurisdiction if they relate only to the common crew.<BR>

Keep in mind that an emotional reaction will often do more harm than good. Remain detached, practical, and disciplined. Silence is preferable to something regrettable.<BR>


<BR><BR><center><b>Station Regulations Relating to Blueshields & Bodyguard Authority</b></center><BR><BR>


The rules of engagement do not apply to you as they do to Security; you are free to hold your gear in plain view. In a stable situation, you have no legitimate authority over the standard crew and they have none over you. Always be prepared to do whatever it takes to protect VIPs.<BR>

It is up to the VIPs to enable their sensors unless the alert level raises, despite the monitoring computers in your office.<BR>

In a crisis, you are authorized to direct the actions of VIPs. You have the right to demand that VIPs follow you to safety; however, they may refuse, and it is not recommended to use force to direct them unless their preferred action is certain death. It is your jurisdiction and responsibility as a Blueshield to use your authority optimally for all parties involved.<BR>

Security is authorized to lawfully detain, search, interrogate, and arrest both VIPs and you. This is not dangerous. Do not interfere in an investigation unless the VIP is in genuine danger. Do not break VIPs out of the Brig. Internal Affairs will also monitor and observe your conduct and their mandate applies equally to Security and Blueshield operations.


<BR><BR><center><b>The Fax Machine</b></center><BR><BR>

As a Nanotrasen agent, Central Command’s Department of Truth will be more than inclined to respond to any faxes sent by you. With proper authorization, Central Command has been known to send Emergency Response Teams, as well as teams of Blueshields to reinforce VIP protection, supplies, advice, personal evacuation crafts, and other forms of assistance.<BR>

It is recommended to be polite, brief, formal and to always sign your name before sending the fax. Remember that Central Command will not have the same knowledge of the station as you, and may be relying entirely on your report of the situation to decide how to proceed.<BR>

You may use the fax machine if you suspect any personnel of the station is harboring particularly anti-Nanotrasen sentiments. Do not be afraid to ask for anything if it is truly necessary.

<BR><BR><center><b>Conflict Resolution</b></center><BR><BR>
 
Although Blueshields are armed to take on any standard station threat, the use of your weaponry should still be a last resort. It is not favorable to the future of the VIP if you mow down every Assistant who casts a threatening glance, although ruthlessness has its place. If possible, always try to talk down any threats, whether by use of intimidation, negotiation, or any other coercion.<BR>

The Deckard should only be used in emergencies or in a case where the taser would be ineffective. That said, the Deckard can also take .357 in an emergency.<BR>

Your life, in relevance to the VIPs, is meaningless. You are expendable.  Use yourself as a literal shield against bullets, if needs be, to save a VIP.<BR>

Special Case: Hostage Situation
This is a situation that will require all of your tact and planning. Do whatever you have to do to keep the VIP safe, whether that means surrendering yourself (if it can be done in a way ensuring the VIP’s safety), an ID, or any weaponry or lesser crew. Any material loss can be recuperated; a dead VIP cannot.<BR>

Be accommodating but firm in your requests to regain the VIP unless you are certain the aggressor will attack the VIP. Call Security if you can, and try to work with them.<BR>

Cloning is far from perfect. Assume every death will be permanent when dealing with a VIP's life.<BR>

Keep in mind that these are only regulations. Events on board the station may nullify parts of this document, especially if they conflict with the wellbeing of a VIP. Use your knowledge of the situation, and discard the entirety of this paper if needed.<BR>
