#/tg/station's dmi tool

This is a replacement for the old Java-based `dmitool` that was inherited from Baystation12.

And because there were no documentation for it other than this wiki page at tgstation's wiki. On how to resolve icon conflicts, which this is intended to help with. https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Resolving_icon_conflicts

This what you get, for now.
