	description = "Arkships are generation ships with hundreds thousands \
	cryosleepers to keep the crew and sleepers in comfort and stasis against \
	the wear of aging and the elements of the cold void. The reason how and why \
	the Arkships exist are thought to be an constant escape from an ancient \
	threat that destroyed the old Vox homes; the Galactic Crisis. Every now and \
	then a fraction of the sleepers are revived to conduct maintenance and \
	collect resources to keep the Arkships running."

	description = "Arkships are for those who believe in running away from a \
	threat, there has been kind like the colonists before, but no one has heard \
	of them again. Instead of sticking to the Arkship life, Vox has settled down \
	for a calm and peaceful life, cursing the old ways and embracing a change of \
	air for new life. This time it is different, never once in hundred cycles \
	have the Vox met an actual civilized sector like this. A new future for the \
	Vox, perhaps!"

	description = "The sheltered life stuck to the old Apex and the Arkships have \
	caused a great stagnation and massive loss of knowledge, the kin sick with \
	dependency on old flawing technology to stay alive. Thanks to cowardice the \
	old homeworlds are destroyed and far far away. Enough is enough, itâ€™s time to \
	for once settle down on a world and rebuild a world like the old home as how \
	the Vox can remember it, and regain the Vox their own identity."
