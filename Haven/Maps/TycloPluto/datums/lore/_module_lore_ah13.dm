  Because I don't have the resources or the time to go make a more sane rewrite
  of the system used by Baycode. Specially not one that relies on macros as
  a total solution to everything.

  Here's an explanation of how Bay's system serves as evidence of how Bay is
  completely stripped of any sign of intelligence and rational thinking.
  Fuck you, Bay, with a five-grit sandpaper cactus.

  Either way, this is how the sytem works:

  1. Define name macros with human-readable string values
  2. Use the macros inside /decl/culture_info declarations and definitions
  3. Put them inside species datums' available_cultural_info list of associated
    lists with corresponding tags;
    - Cultures                -> TAG_CULTURE
    - Factions | nations      -> TAG_FACTION
    - Locations | homeworlds  -> TAG_HOMEWORLD
  4. The game looks up those strings inserted from the macros and return it

  And you're done. Enjoy your technical debt!

  Also, this one file should be marked as included in either the .dme or from
  inside the map's top-level .dm, you decide. In the original, it was included
  from the top-level .dm.
