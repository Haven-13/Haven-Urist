changes:
  - tweak: The preview is now tgstation-based instead of using a static image. Using
      a map for easy, clean, and reliable updating.
  - tweak: There are now three different backgrounds to select for the preview instead
      of four.
  - bugfix: The shadow-people have been sent back to the shadow realm from the character
      creator preview.
  - bugfix: As of the above tweak, the delay that causes a discrepancy between client
      and server has been removed.
