#List the potential random ruins here. This file is for small things that would appear in space, like an asteroid or broken escape pod.
#Maps must be the full path to them
#Ruins should be 40x40 at max. Anymore than that will break the game.
#SPECIFYING AN INVALID MAP WILL RESULT IN RUNTIMES ON GAME START
